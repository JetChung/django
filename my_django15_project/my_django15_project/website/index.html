            <h1>Jet Chung</h1>
            <p align="center">The brawns of the company, this is Jets first time trying his hand at coding.
                He likes to think he's good at math, although he didn't qualify for the AMC 10 in 7th grade.
                He used to be able to solve a Rubiks cube in 20 seconds, now it takes him 1 minute. He is the one who
                wrote these strange biographies.</p>
            <p align="center">
                Follow him at: Snapchat: JetChung1@gmail.com Instagram: JetChung1@gmail.com Twitter:
                @JetChung1@gmail.com
                Fun fact: He once forgot an "i" in Mingles email.</p>

            <h1>Mingle Li</h1>
            <p align="center">Mingle, on the other hand, actually knows what he is doing. He has many years of
                experience in Java and web development, unlike Jet who has to use Bootstrap. </p>
            <p align="center">
                Mingle, unlike Jet, actually has social media. Follow him at: Snapchat: idk Instagram: idk Twitter: @idk
                Fun fact: He has a rackmount server in his house or something.</p>
